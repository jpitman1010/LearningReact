npm start     starts the app in react so that you can run on localhost:3000
    -make sure you are inside of the directory that has the files, not a parent directory, when using this prompt


for each file, you MUST::
     export default (filename);
and then in the index file:
    import (the function name (i.e. Header)) from (the location the file is found(i.e. './components/header'));


refer to header file for an idea of dynamic content: date in header updating each time run...  
can also return math operations (but can only return 1 thing per file imported/exported)




can use google font to find font styles
    -when labeling div(or other tag) with class, use className="" not class=""


handling REACT Events (like form inputs) uses SyntheticEvent which is already built in React 
(scroll down to get all the diff events it supports); docs ref:
        https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html    
        examples lines 80 through 162 in header.js

line 204 -260 begins adding in STATE

the state is like a tiny database inside of each component, which can hold and update info
as the method instructs  



PROPS
begins header.js line 273

import json file into index.js
then in order to have the different objects within json file added to news section, go into news_list.js
import news_list.js into index.js (also export from within news_list.js)

PROPS part 2:
uses news_list_item.js and renders props.item from this file to news_list.js file;



PROPS 3: props passed from a class component to a class
footer.js added and index.js updated

REACT Children: updating index.js NewsList tag ...
