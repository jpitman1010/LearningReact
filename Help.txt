npm start     starts the app in react so that you can run on localhost:3000
    -make sure you are inside of the directory that has the files, not a parent directory, when using this prompt


for each file, you MUST::
     export default (filename);
and then in the index file:
    import (the function name (i.e. Header)) from (the location the file is found(i.e. './components/header'));


refer to header file for an idea of dynamic content: date in header updating each time run...  
can also return math operations (but can only return 1 thing per file imported/exported)




can use google font to find font styles
    -when labeling div(or other tag) with class, use className="" not class=""
